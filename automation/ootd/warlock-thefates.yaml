      text: Starting at 1st level, you are expected to consult with the Fates each
        morning to learn what they have planned for you. You can cast one
        divination spell without expending a spell slot immediately after
        finishing a short or long rest. If you do so, you gain temporary hit
        points equal to your warlock level (minimum of 1). You must choose a
        spell that you can cast normally, and must have the necessary material
        components.

        check made by you or a creature that you can see with this roll. You
        must choose to do so before the roll. This foretelling roll can be used
        only once. When you finish a short or long rest, you lose any unused
        foretelling rolls.

        Starting at 14th level, you learn to accelerate the entropic power of
        fate. You can use an action to force a creature you can see to make a
        Wisdom saving throw. If the creature is unaware of your presence, then
        it has disadvantage on the roll. If the creature fails the saving throw,
        choose another creature that you can see. The first creature is
        compelled by fate to move toward the second creature for 1 minute.


        At the beginning of each of the first creature’s turns, if it is not located within 5 feet of the second creature, then the first creature takes 2d10 psychic damage, and it must use its full movement to move closer to the second creature, dashing if necessary, even if it cannot reach them. This effect ends if you or either of the two creatures are reduced to 0 hit points or become unconscious. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
