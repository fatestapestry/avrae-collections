                DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1
                minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't
                hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A
                creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of
                each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A
                creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the
                effect of these pipes for 24 hours.

      text: You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have
        3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to
        create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you
        that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
        become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the
