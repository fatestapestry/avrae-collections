Adds a custom ability check to the active character.

You may use any of the built in 5e skills or ability checks as the base check.

If desired, you may also specify what level of proficiency your character has with the given check using a 1 for proficiency, a 2 for expertise, or 0.5 for half-profiency (such as from Jack of all Trades).

You may also optionally add any additional arguments that you might want to be passed to the built in check function (such as using another stat, adv/dis, a one-time bonus, etc.).
