# Called Shots

*A collection of snippets for implementing called shots in D&D 5e combat. These snippets modify attacks to target specific body parts by applying disadvantage and appropriate penalties to hit, representing the increased difficulty of targeting specific locations.*

## Version

## Examples
Basic usage:
```
!a sword arms
```
```
!a sword -t goblin arms
```

Available targets:
- `Arms (+2 AC)`
- `Wings (+2 AC)`
- `Chest (+0 AC)`
- `Ear (+4 AC)`
- `Eye (+4 AC)`
- `Hands (+2 AC)`
- `Head (+2 AC)`
- `Heart (+4 AC)`
- `Leg (+2 AC)`
- `Neck (+2 AC)`
- `Vitals (+2 AC)`
