# Heroic Inspiration

*Manage and roll Heroic Inspiration points for your characters*

## Version
v1.0.0

## Examples
Basic usage:
```
!heroic
```
Rolls a `1d20` for Heroic Inspiration.

```
!heroic -die 1d10
```
Rolls a `1d10` for Heroic Inspiration.

Available options:
- `-die <str>`: Allows you to specify a custom die for the roll (default is `1d20`).
- `add`: Adds a Heroic Inspiration point.
- `del`: Removes a Heroic Inspiration point.

# Notes
- The Heroic Inspiration counter is automatically created if it doesn't already exist.
- The `add` and `del` options modify the counter without rolling a die.
