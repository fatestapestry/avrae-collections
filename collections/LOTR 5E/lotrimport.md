`!lotrimport`

## Description
Imports class-specific features for the active character based on their level and subclass. The alias automatically retrieves and applies the relevant features from predefined data sources.

## Arguments
This alias does not take any inputs or arguments.

## Examples
```plaintext
!lotrimport
```
Automatically imports all class and subclass features available for the active character.

## Notes
- The alias determines available features based on the character's class, level, and subclass.
- Only features that match the character's level and subclass will be imported.
- The alias works dynamically based on the character's `!level` setup.
