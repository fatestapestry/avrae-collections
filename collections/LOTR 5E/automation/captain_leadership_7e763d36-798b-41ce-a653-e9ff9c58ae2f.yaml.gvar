      text: You possess the ability to direct others to actionâ€”when under pressure,
        other people naturally turn to you for guidance. As an action in combat,
        choose a number of friendly creatures (which can include yourself)
        within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you and who can understand
        you, up to twice your proficiency bonus. Each creature can gain
        temporary hit points equal to your Captain level + your Charisma
        modifier. These temporary hit points last until they are depleted or the
        creature finishes a short or long rest. You must then finish a short or
        long rest to use this feature again.
