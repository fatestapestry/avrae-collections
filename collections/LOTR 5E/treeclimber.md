**Tree-Climber.** Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, you can add your Dexterity modifier to Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb or jump, and to the distance you cover (in feet) when you make a running jump.
