**Blessing Die.** The bearer of a Marvellous Artefact or Wondrous Item can roll a Blessing die and add the number rolled to the ability checks affected by the blessings. The Blessing die is determined by the bearerâ€™s proficiency bonus, as shown in the table below. A character can roll only one Blessing die on each check.
