If the save fails by 5 or more, the target gains 4 Shadow points instead of 2 and has disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws while charmed in this way.\n\nIf the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from Old Man Willow, the target must move on its turn toward Old Man Willow by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into a hazard, such as thorns or water, and whenever it takes damage, a target can repeat the saving throw. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.\n\nIf the charmed target ends its turn within 5 feet of Old Man Willow, it falls asleep and is unconscious and no longer charmed. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it.\n\nA target that successfully saves is immune to Old Man Willow’s spell for the next 24 hours.",
