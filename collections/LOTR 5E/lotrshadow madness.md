`!lotrshadow madness`

## Description
Handles a bout of Shadow Madness, clearing all Shadow Points and advancing the character's Shadow Path by adding a new flaw. Represents the deepening corruption and mental strain caused by the Shadow.

## Arguments
- No positional arguments or optional arguments.

## Examples
- Experience a bout of madness and update the Shadow Path:  
  `!lotrshadow madness`

## Notes
- Clears all Shadow Points and adds a new flaw from the character's Shadow Path.
- Prevents action if:
  - Shadow Points are not at their maximum.
  - The Shadow Path is already fully corrupted (all flaws acquired).
- Designed to align with the mechanics of the "Lord of the Rings" system.
- When the Shadow Path is fully corrupted, the next bout of madness results in succumbing entirely to the Shadow.
